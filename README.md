## Method Types

### Qualitative Metrics (Why & How)
Qualitative metrics are subjective **opinions** formed based on the current information. 

#### How To Measure
1. Define success for each persona [Goal](#goals)
2. Define success for each persona [Objective](#objectives)
3. Define success for each persona [Activity](#activites)
4. Actively solicit [Feedback](#feedback) from each persona
5. Iteratively gage the [Satisfaction](#satisfaction) for each persona

### Qantitative Metrics (What)
Quantitative metrics are those **objective facts** which provde specific numerical values. 

#### How To Measure By Persona
1. Persona [Health Score](#health-score)
2. Persona [Churn Rate](#chrun-rate)
3. Persona [Recurring Engagement](#recurring-engagement)
4. Persona [Lifetime Value](#lifetime-value)
5. Persona [Retention Cost](#retention-cost)

## Definitions

### Health Score
Health score gives information about the health of a given persona. Taking into account various behavioral aspects along with pre-defined criteria for what is considered good or bad for success.

### Churn Rate
It is the rate at which a given persona stops engaging. It is a clear indicator of how effectively you are managing the relationship.
